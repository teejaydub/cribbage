        '''
        Executes a single round of cribbage.

            Play proceeds through a succession of "hands", each hand
            consisting of a "deal", "the play" and "the show." At any
            time during any of these stages, if a player reaches the
            target score (usually 121), play ends immediately with
            that player being the winner of the game. This can even
            happen during the deal, since the dealer can score if a
            Jack is cut as the starter.

        Returns True if the game is not over after the round; False if
        the game is over (or was already over before the round).
