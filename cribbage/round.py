        Shuffles and deals the cards for a single round of cribbage.

            The dealer shuffles and deals six cards to each player.
            Once the cards have been dealt, each player chooses four
            cards to retain, then discards the other two face-down to
            form the "crib", which will be used later by the dealer.
            At this point, each player's hand and the crib will
            contain exactly four cards. The player on the dealer's
            left cuts the deck and the dealer reveals the top card,
            called the "starter" or the "cut". If this card is a Jack,

        '''
        Plays out cards (pegging) for a single round of cribbage.

            Starting with the non-dealer player, each player in turn
            lays one card face up on the table in front of him or her,
            stating the count--that is, the cumulative value of the
            cards that have been laid (for example, the first player
            lays a five and says "five", the next lays a six and says
            "eleven", and so on)--without the count going above
            31. The cards are not laid in the centre of the table as,
            at the end of the "play," each player needs to pick up the
            cards they have laid. Players score points during this
            process for causing the count to reach exactly fifteen,
            for runs (consecutively played, but not necessarily in
            order) and for pairs. Three or four of a kind are counted
            as multiple pairs: three of a kind is the same as three
            different pairs, or 6 points, and four of a kind is 6
            different kinds of pairs, or 12 points.

            If a player cannot play without causing the count exceed
            31, he calls "Go." Continuing with the player on his left,
            the other player(s) continue(s) the play until no one can
            play without the count exceeding 31. A player is obligated
            to play a card unless there is no card in their hand that
            can be played without the count exceeding 31 (one cannot
            voluntarily pass). Once 31 is reached or no one is able to
            play, the player who played the last card scores one point
            if the count is still under 31 and two if it is exactly
            31. The count is then reset to zero and those players with
            cards remaining repeat the process starting with the
            player to the left of the player who played the last
            card. When no player has any cards the game proceeds to
            the "show."

            Players choose the order in which to lay their cards in
            order to maximize their scores; experienced players refer
            to this as either good or poor "pegging" or
            "pegsmanship". If one player reaches the target (usually
            61 or 121), the game ends immediately and that player
            wins. When the scores are level during a game, the
            players' pegs will be side by side, and it is thought that
            this gave rise to the phrase "level pegging".[5]

        Returns True if the game is not over after the play; False if
        the game is over (or was already over before the play).

        Scores all hands after a round of cribbage.

            Once the play is complete, each player in turn, starting
            with the player on the left of the dealer, displays his
            hand on the table and scores points based on its content
            in conjunction with the starter card. Points are scored
            for combinations of cards totalling fifteen, runs, pairs
            (multiple pairs are scored pair by pair, but may be
            referred to as three or four of a kind), a flush and
            having a Jack of the same suit as the starter card ("one
            for his nob [or nobs or nibs]"). A four-card flush scores
            four and cannot include the cut or starter; a five-card
            flush scores five.

            The dealer scores his hand last and then turns the cards
            in the crib face up. These cards are then scored by the
            dealer as an additional hand, also in conjunction with the
            starter card. Unlike the dealer's own hand, the crib
            cannot score a four-card flush, but it can score a
            five-card flush with the starter.

            All scores from 0 to 29 are possible, with the exception
            of 19, 25, 26 and 27.[6] Players may refer colloquially to
            a hand scoring zero points as having a score of
            nineteen.[7]
